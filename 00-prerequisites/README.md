# Prerequisites Labs

Before you go too far, you need to have the following tools installed on your machine:
* Git 2.x
* Python 3.9+ (prefer 3.10.x)
* An IDE of your choosing. I prefer either PyCharm or VSCode, but I'll do my best to help you in another IDE.

You'll also need a free Pulumi account, the Pulumi CLI, free cloud accounts on GCP and AWS, and the related SDKs. If you don't know how to get those tools, use the following labs to get all set up.

- [Lab 00.01: Getting a Pulumi account](./00.01/README.md)
- [Lab 00.02: Getting the Pulumi CLI](./00.02/README.md)
- [Lab 00.03: Getting free cloud accounts](./00.03/README.md)
- [Lab 00.04: Setting up the CLIs and SDKs](./00.04/README.md)
