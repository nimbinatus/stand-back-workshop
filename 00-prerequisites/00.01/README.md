# Lab 00.01: Getting a Pulumi account

First, you need to create a free Pulumi SaaS account. It's the SaaS offering of the open-source Pulumi project, which includes the state storage part that we're interested in and the related SDKs. Pulumi state storage is free forever for developers, and it's easier than hosting the open-source version yourself. Head to the [Pulumi Signup Page](https://app.pulumi.com/signup?utm_source=laura&utm_medium=developer-advocate&utm_campaign=kcdc2022) to sign up.[^1]

Once you're logged in, you want to get an access token. Create an access token using the following steps:
1. Select your profile picture.
1. Select **Settings**.
1. Select **Access Tokens**.
1. Select **Create token**.
1. Copy the access token somewhere secure. You'll need it for the CLI.
